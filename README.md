# Data Analysis Portfolio Project

## Bank Loan Report

Overview: This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing bank loan data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can assist in decision-making processes. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of loan approvals, customer demographics, and risk factors. 

**Tools Used:**

 * SQL: Employed for data extraction, cleaning, and manipulation. Queries were written to aggregate data, calculate key metrics, and perform complex joins to create a clean dataset for analysis.
 * Power BI: Utilized for data visualization and report generation. Dashboards were created to display interactive charts, graphs, and summaries, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring the data.

**Objectives:**

* Analyze customer profiles to identify key factors influencing loan approvals.
* Visualize the distribution of approved vs. rejected loans across different customer segments.
* Create interactive dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights into loan performance and risk assessment.

**Outcome:** The project resulted in a dynamic and insightful report that can be used by the bank to better understand their loan approval process, optimize their criteria, and minimize risk. The interactive Power BI dashboards enable quick access to key insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
